# TicTacPong
TicTacToe but players can challenge other players moves with a game of pong

## Rules:
* Just like regular game of TicTacToe, three in a row in any direction is a win for either player
* After a player moves the other player is allowed to challenge that move. Players cannot challenge past moves and can only challenge a given move once.
* When the challenge button is pressed, a game of pong is started. If the challenger wins, they are able to take the spot and then move again, if they loose, they loose their turn as well.
